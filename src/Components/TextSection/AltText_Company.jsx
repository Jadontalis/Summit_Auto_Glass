                <p>Qoleton Rammel started Summit Auto Glass in 2020 after working for over 20 years in the autoglass industry 
                    throughout southwest Montana. Following a managerial role at Speedy Glass in Bozeman, 
                    he ventured out and started a shop of his own. Knowing he would have to compete with other established 
                    local companies and franchises, Qoleton's work ethic, attention to detail, and people-centered attitude inevitiably grew the company 
                    from one employee into a full-scale crew. </p>
                <p>Since gaining root in the gallatin valley in 2020. The Summit AG family is a close-knit group of people with one single mission in mind. To provide you the customer with the upmost quality repairs and replacements.</p>
